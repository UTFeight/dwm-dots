* `dwm.s`

I use dwm as my daily driver. Here are some stuff I use along with


** Picom

I use [this fork](https://github.com/dccsillag/picom/tree/implement-window-animations) picom to gain cool animations.

** Neovim

I use NvChad which is just perfect.

** (cha)dwm
This configuration heavily is based on [[github:siduck][siduck]]'s rices (awesome btw.)

** CamelVim
Neovim Configuration based on [[github:NvChad/NvChad][NvChad]] (made by [[github:siduck][siduck]] again) enchanced with community plugins
That is powerful enough.
